# Project Title
Rutgers Bootcamp Project 2 - ETL Mini Project

## Description
Our Team built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data. 
After we transformed the data, we created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. 
Finally, we uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database for future use. 
We added an optional visualization (pie charts) to practice viewing an interesting component of the resulting dataframe.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies (matplotlib, pandas, re, json, numpy)
3. Our team used PostgreSQL. Make note to import tables in order of table creation due to relationships between tables.

## Acknowledgments
- Used Xpert Learning Assistant for assistance debugging.
